HTML Conventions


http://w3schools-fa.ir/html/html5_syntax.html

-Always add the alt attribute to images. This attribute is important when the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
-Also, always define image width and height. It reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.
-Try to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

-Do not add blank lines without a reason.
-For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.
-For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.
-Do not use unnecessary blank lines and indentation. It is not necessary to indent every element

-Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.
-To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, 
 both the language and the character encoding should be defined as early as possible in a document
 
 You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages
 -<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

-Short rules can be written compressed, like this:
p.intro {font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16em;}

-Long rules should be written over multiple lines:
body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16em;
  color: black;
}

-Loading JavaScript
<script src="myscript.js">
Place script tags at the bottom of the document
You can also add a defer tag to your script tags to make sure the HTML gets loaded first.

-always use lower case file names

-Organize DOM: Always consider if you need that extra div or extra element. 
Try to create only the absolute necessary ones and divide only large parts of your page with not divs, but semantic HTML elements. 
The same goes for other places. If you can, always use HTML5 semantic elements. 
It helps search engines know which part is important on your page and which part is not

-Compress
Once youâ€™re done with everything and you are ready to make your site live, compress it.
You can use 3rd party libraries, special programs, or tools called build tools or even online applications. 
It will make your document smaller, which results in faster page load. 
To take this step further, enable brotli or gzip compression at the server-side. 
It can make a huge impact on page speed.

-Take some time to decorate your complex UI elements with aria attributes. 
This brings support for assistive technologies and so you can reach a wider audience.
