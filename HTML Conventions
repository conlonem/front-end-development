HTML Conventions


http://w3schools-fa.ir/html/html5_syntax.html

-Always add the alt attribute to images. This attribute is important when the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
-Also, always define image width and height. It reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.
-Try to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

-Do not add blank lines without a reason.
-For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.
-For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.
-Do not use unnecessary blank lines and indentation. It is not necessary to indent every element

-Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.
-To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, 
 both the language and the character encoding should be defined as early as possible in a document
 
 You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages
 -<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

}
