    <h1>About me and this lovely website</h1>
    <p>My name is E.Conlon and I'm studying Information Technology at the University of Newcastle. 
        I have a passion for creating beautiful, responsive websites and I am slowly self-teaching myself web development.
        This is not my first project, however I do consider this my first project within my portfolio of professional projects.
    </p>
    <p>This website is to digitalise my bucket list for travelling, around my home country (Australia)
         as well as places around the world that I'd love to visit.</p>
