Web Hosting 

Website hosting is where you store the files that make up your website. 
So while people will visit your URL, the domain needs to locate the images, the text and the site design youâ€™re hosting to let people see 
your site in all its glory. Hosting prices vary dramatically, depending on the features offered, the reliability of the service and how 
many extras you want. As with domain name registration, hosting is generally renewed on an annual basis.

Client-side Validation

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation

-Can use built in (better performance) or JS (customisable) to validate

-required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
<input id="choose" name="i_like" required>
input:invalid:required {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, pink, lightgreen);
}
For good user experience, indicate to the user when form fields are required

-minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)
<input type="text" id="choose" name="i_like" required minlength="6" maxlength="6">

-min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types
<input type="number" id="number" name="amount" value="1" min="1" max="10">

-type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type. 
-pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.
<input id="choose" name="i_like" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry">

When an element is valid
- :valid CSS pseudo-class which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.
-browser will submit the form

input:valid {
  border: 2px solid black;
}

When an element is invalid
-matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class
-won't submit, displays error message

input:invalid {
  border: 2px dashed red;
}

Note: There are several errors that will prevent the form from being submitted, 
including a badInput, patternMismatch, rangeOverflow or rangeUnderflow, stepMismatch, 
tooLong or tooShort, typeMismatch, valueMissing, or a customError.
